# AI Search Discovery & Technical Readiness Guide
**Project:** ARILHA E-Commerce Platform (`arilha.com`)  
**Document Purpose:** Technical architecture overview, verification status, and manual setup recommendations for search engine indexing, Google Merchant Center, and AI discovery.

## 1. Technical Implementations Completed

### Phase 1: Technical SEO & Metadata Architecture
- **Server Component Route Architecture**: Refactored `/product/[slug]` into a Server Component wrapper with dynamic `generateMetadata({ params })` returning product-specific title, description, OpenGraph image, and canonical URL.
- **Dynamic Sitemap**: Created `/sitemap.xml` indexing all static pages, active category URLs, and active product URLs (`/product/[slug]`).
- **Robots Directives**: Created `/robots.txt` allowing public storefront pages and disallowing private user/cart/checkout routes.
- **Canonicalization**: Implemented `<link rel="canonical">` metadata across all public pages.

### Phase 2: Product Discoverability & Merchant Feed
- **Google Merchant Product Feed Endpoint**: Created `GET /api/v1/feeds/google-merchant` returning standard RSS 2.0 XML (with `xmlns:g="http://base.google.com/ns/1.0"`) and JSON format (`?format=json`).
- **Variant Structured Data**: Injected multi-offer schema arrays into `@type: "Product"` JSON-LD mapping each variant's SKU, price, and stock status (`InStock` vs `OutOfStock`).
- **Shipping & Return Policy Schema**: Injected `MerchantReturnPolicy` (7-day finite return window) and `OfferShippingDetails` (₹0 shipping for ₹1,499+ orders across India) into Offer JSON-LD.

### Phase 3: Brand Authority & Content Foundation
- **Category SEO Copy & Internal Links**: Added category SEO description blocks and cross-category internal navigation links to `/shop`.
- **FAQ Google Rich Snippet Schema**: Injected `@type: "FAQPage"` JSON-LD into `/faq` mapping genuine questions and answers.
- **Style Journal Foundation**: Created `/journal` index and `/journal/[slug]` dynamic article reader with `@type: "Article"` JSON-LD schema, publication dates, and author metadata.

### Phase 4: AI Search Discovery & Machine Readability
- **`llms.txt`**: Created `/llms.txt` providing factual brand overview, category hierarchy, policy links, and sitemap/feed references for AI web crawlers.
- **Organization & WebSite Schema Alignment**: Aligned global JSON-LD schemas in `JsonLd.tsx` for consistent brand identity across search engines.

## 2. What the Website is Ready For

1. **Google & Bing Web Crawling**: Clean standards-compliant `robots.txt` and dynamic `sitemap.xml` automatically feed search bots.
2. **Google Shopping & Meta Catalog Sync**: Public XML feed at `https://arilha.com/api/v1/feeds/google-merchant` is ready to link directly to Google Merchant Center and Meta Commerce Manager.
3. **Structured Data Rich Results**: Validated `Product`, `Offer`, `BreadcrumbList`, `Organization`, `WebSite`, `FAQPage`, and `Article` JSON-LD schemas enable Google Rich Snippets (price badges, stock status, FAQ accordions, article metadata).
4. **AI Agent Machine Readability**: `/llms.txt` and REST endpoints (`/api/v1/products`, `/api/v1/categories`) provide structured product and policy data for AI tools and commerce crawlers.

### A. Google Search Console
1. Log in to [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console).
2. Add property `https://arilha.com`.
3. Verify domain ownership (via DNS TXT record or HTML tag).
4. Submit sitemap URL: `https://arilha.com/sitemap.xml`.

### B. Bing Webmaster Tools
1. Log in to [Bing Webmaster Tools](https://www.bing.com/webmasters).
2. Import property from Google Search Console or add `https://arilha.com` manually.
3. Submit sitemap URL: `https://arilha.com/sitemap.xml`.

### C. Google Merchant Center

### D. External Brand Authority Setup
1. **Google Business Profile**: If ARILHA maintains an eligible physical office/studio presence in India, create a verified Google Business Profile to strengthen local entity authority.
2. **Official Social Channels**: Link verified Instagram (`https://instagram.com/arilha`) and Facebook profiles to reinforce `sameAs` Organization schema.
3. **Organic Customer Reviews**: Encourage verified customers to leave authentic reviews on Google and website product pages.

## 4. Technical Discoverability vs. AI Recommendations Disclosure

> **IMPORTANT NOTICE:**  
> Technical SEO, structured data (JSON-LD), XML feeds, and `/llms.txt` ensure that search engines, web crawlers, and AI platforms can **accurately crawl, parse, and understand** ARILHA's public catalog and policies.  
>  
> However, **no technical implementation guarantees** that AI platforms (such as ChatGPT, Google Gemini, Claude, Perplexity, or Grok) will explicitly cite, rank, or recommend ARILHA for specific user queries. AI model outputs are non-deterministic and rely on broader off-page brand authority, domain age, organic mentions, and independent consumer reviews over time.
